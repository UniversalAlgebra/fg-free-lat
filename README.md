## Kernels of epimorphisms of finitely generated free lattices

The notes in the directory `tex-notes` give a proof of the following:

**Theorem.**
Let $X$ be a finite set and $\mathbf F := \mathbf F(X)$ the free lattice generated by $X$.
Suppose $\mathbf L = \langle L, \wedge, \vee\rangle$ is a finite lattice and 
$h\colon \mathbf{F} \twoheadrightarrow \mathbf{L}$ a lattice epimorphism.
If $h$ is bounded then the kernel of $h$ is a finitely generated sublattice 
of $\mathbf F \times \mathbf F$.

We also detail some of the progress we have made towards the converse; that is, 
we are still trying to prove the following:

**Conjecture.**
Suppose $\mathbf L = \langle L, \wedge, \vee\rangle$ is a finite lattice and 
$h\colon \mathbf F \twoheadrightarrow \mathbf L$ a lattice epimorphism.
If the kernel of $h$ is a finitely generated sublattice 
of $\mathbf F \times \mathbf F$, then $h$ is bounded.

---

We know how to prove the conjecture if we assume that, 
whenever $h$ is not upper (lower) bounded, then there is a class of 
$\ker h$ that contains an infinite ascending (descending) chain as well as a meet (join)
prime element of $\mathbf F$.  However, we know of examples in which this 
hypothesis fails to hold.
