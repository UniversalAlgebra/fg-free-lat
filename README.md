## Kernels of epimorphisms of finitely generated free lattices

Original research by William DeMeo, Peter Myer, and Nik Ruskuc.

---

The notes in the directory `tex-notes` give a proof of the following:

**Theorem.**
Let $X$ be a finite set and $\mathbf F := \mathbf F(X)$ the free lattice generated by $X$.
Suppose $\mathbf L = \langle L, \wedge, \vee\rangle$ is a finite lattice and 
$h\colon \mathbf{F} \rightarrow \mathbf{L}$ a lattice epimorphism.
Then $h$ is *bounded* iff the kernel of $h$ is a finitely generated sublattice 
of $\mathbf F \times \mathbf F$.
