A collection of our notes on fiber products of lattices:

fg-free-lat4    my latest write-up with references to the following
fg-free-lat2    kernels of bounded homs are fg
scan2   comments on the proof that kernels of bounded homs are fg
unbounded-lattice-example   Nik's example of an unbounded hom with fg kernel
subdirect18   the previous version of Nik's example 7.5



Random remarks:


1) The 14 element lattice L on which Nik's example is based is just the subgroup lattice of (Z_2)^3.

Equivalently without top and bottom L is the projective plane of order 2. Nik's description is based on its presentation with the difference set {0,1,3} in Z_7.

I don't see whether the infinite lattice N is some known object but I now believe that Nik's example is less random than what I previously thought.

2) Generating the kernel of \psi: N -> L seems to use that N is not modular in an essential way. It's unclear to me whether there exists some unbounded h: A -> B for a modular lattice A such that ker h is finitely generated.

3) My experiments with A the free modular lattice on 4 elements went nowhere because I could not find a good description of its elements.
